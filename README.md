# Rain-prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

Rainfall unpredictability poses challenges in agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. This project aims to build a machine learning classification system to predict whether it will rain the next day. Using the WeatherAUS dataset, which contains 10 years of daily weather observations across Australia, the model focuses on forecasting the binary target variable, RainTomorrow.
The process involves data cleaning, feature selection, and model training. Key predictors include MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, Humidity3pm, and RainToday. Categorical variables are encoded, and missing values are imputed. Models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree are tested, with Random Forest achieving the best accuracy (~85%) due to its ensemble nature.
The implementation uses Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The project is modular, including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction stages. The system shows strong potential for use in agriculture and risk mitigation. Future work may involve real-time data integration and the use of deep learning models for extended forecasting.
